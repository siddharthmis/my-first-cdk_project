I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you about a change in my current plans regarding my career aspirations. Initially, I had anticipated moving onsite as part of our project, but unfortunately, this could not materialize as expected. As I am still keen on pursuing an onsite opportunity, I would like to kindly request that you consider releasing me from my current project should a suitable onsite opportunity arise in the future.

I remain committed to contributing to the success of the project and will continue to give my best in my current role. However, I wanted to make sure that you are aware of my future aspirations should the right opportunity present itself.

Thank you for understanding, and I appreciate your continued support.

Best regards,
