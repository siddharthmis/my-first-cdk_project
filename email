Subject: Request for Compensation Adjustment for Relocation to Canada

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to express my gratitude for the opportunity to relocate to Canada and continue contributing to our organization's success. I am genuinely excited about this opportunity and the potential for both professional and personal growth it offers.

However, after thorough consideration, I have realized that the current compensation package may not sufficiently cover the increased cost of living and the expenses associated with relocating my family. As a result, I am concerned about the financial implications of this move on my family and myself.

To ensure a smooth transition and maintain the financial stability that allows me to focus entirely on my work, I kindly request a review and adjustment of the compensation package being offered. An increase in compensation would greatly alleviate the financial strain and allow us to move forward with confidence and enthusiasm.

I am more than willing to discuss this matter further and provide any additional information needed to support my request. I am confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial arrangement that supports both my family’s needs and the organization’s goals.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your understanding and support in this matter.

Best regards,
