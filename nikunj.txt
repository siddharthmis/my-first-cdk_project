. Use Disk Cleanup
Open the Disk Cleanup tool:
Press Windows Key + R, type cleanmgr, and press Enter.
Select the system drive (usually C:) and click OK.
Click Clean up system files.
Select the system drive again and click OK.
In the list of files to delete, look for Windows Update Cleanup and select it.
Click OK to start the cleanup.
2. Dism.exe Tool
You can use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to clean up the WinSxS folder.

Steps:
Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

Run the following command to start the cleanup:

cmd
Copy code
Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
If you also want to remove unused versions of system files (which can't be uninstalled):

cmd
Copy code
Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
Note: The /ResetBase option removes all superseded versions of every component in the component store. This action cannot be undone.

To remove uninstalled Windows updates:

cmd
Copy code
Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded
3. Use Task Scheduler (Automatic Cleanup)
Windows has a built-in task called StartComponentCleanup that automatically cleans up the WinSxS folder.

Steps:
Open Task Scheduler (Windows Key + R, type taskschd.msc, and press Enter).
Navigate to:
arduino
Copy code
Task Scheduler Library > Microsoft > Windows > Servicing
Right-click on StartComponentCleanup and select Run.
4. Manually Delete Service Pack Backup Files
If you've recently installed a Service Pack, you can remove its backup files.

Steps:
Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

Run:

cmd
Copy code
Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded
5. Reduce System Restore Points
Old restore points can consume significant disk space.

Steps:
Open System Properties (Windows Key + Pause/Break, then click Advanced system settings).
Go to the System Protection tab.
Select the system drive and click Configure.
Adjust the Disk Space Usage slider or delete old restore points by clicking Delete.
