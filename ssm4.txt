Write a Lambda function in Python to send an email using SES with the details of the AWS Patch maintenance window after it is finished with details including the missing patch count per ec2 instance.

ChatGPT
To create a Lambda function that sends an email using Amazon SES with details of AWS Patch maintenance windows after they have finished, including the missing patch count per EC2 instance, you will need to combine several AWS services:

AWS Systems Manager: To get details on the patch maintenance windows and the patch compliance status of EC2 instances.
Amazon Simple Email Service (SES): To send the email.
AWS Lambda: To execute the function based on a trigger that the maintenance window has finished.
Here is how you can set up and write the Lambda function:

Setting Up Your Environment
Verify Email Addresses: Before sending emails through SES, make sure the email addresses you're going to use (sender and receiver) are verified in your AWS SES dashboard.
IAM Role: Ensure the Lambda function has an IAM role with permissions to access Systems Manager for patch data, read EC2 instance details, and send emails via SES.
Example Python Lambda Function
This example assumes a trigger can be set up (e.g., via CloudWatch Events or another mechanism) to execute this function when a maintenance window finishes.

python
Copy code
import boto3
from datetime import datetime

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Initialize clients
    ssm = boto3.client('ssm')
    ses = boto3.client('ses')
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

    # Assuming 'event' contains the maintenance window ID and instance IDs
    maintenance_window_id = event.get('maintenance_window_id')
    instance_ids = event.get('instance_ids')

    if not maintenance_window_id or not instance_ids:
        return "Maintenance window ID or instance IDs missing in the event data."

    # Fetch patch compliance information
    compliance_info = ssm.describe_instance_patch_states(
        InstanceIds=instance_ids
    )

    # Construct the email body
    html_body = "<h1>AWS Patch Maintenance Window Report</h1>"
    html_body += f"<p>Maintenance Window ID: {maintenance_window_id} has completed.</p>"
    html_body += "<h2>Instance Patch Summary:</h2>"
    html_body += "<ul>"

    for instance in compliance_info['InstancePatchStates']:
        html_body += f"<li>{instance['InstanceId']}: Missing patches - {instance['MissingCount']}</li>"

    html_body += "</ul>"

    # Sending the email through SES
    response = ses.send_email(
        Source='sender@example.com',
        Destination={
            'ToAddresses': ['recipient@example.com']
        },
        Message={
            'Subject': {
                'Data': 'AWS Patch Maintenance Window Completion Report',
                'Charset': 'UTF-8'
            },
            'Body': {
                'Html': {
                    'Data': html_body,
                    'Charset': 'UTF-8'
                }
            }
        }
    )

    return response

Key Elements of the Function:
Maintenance Window ID and Instance IDs: The function assumes that these details are passed via the event object. This setup might need to be adjusted based on how your Lambda is triggered.
Patch Compliance: The function fetches the patch compliance status for the instances using describe_instance_patch_states.
Email Construction and Sending: The email content is created in HTML format and sent using SES.
Permissions Needed:
The IAM role associated with this Lambda function will need the AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess, AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess, and AmazonSESFullAccess policies.
Deployment and Trigger:
You would deploy this Lambda function via the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Infrastructure as Code tools like AWS CloudFormation.
The trigger mechanism would need to be defined based on how you detect the completion of maintenance windows. This might involve using CloudWatch Events that respond to SSM Maintenance Window events.
This setup provides a basic framework. Depending on your specific AWS environment and requirements, further customization may be necessary.

I would like this Lambda to be triggered as soon as patch maintenance window ends, can you add the logic or AWS service to trigger it?
ChatGPT
To trigger an AWS Lambda function as soon as a patch maintenance window ends, you can utilize Amazon CloudWatch Events (now part of Amazon EventBridge) to listen for specific Systems Manager (SSM) events related to maintenance windows. EventBridge allows you to set up rules that match events and route them to various AWS services like Lambda.

Here's how you can set up EventBridge to trigger your Lambda function upon the completion of a maintenance window:

Steps to Configure the EventBridge Rule:
Create a new Rule in EventBridge:
Go to the Amazon EventBridge console.
Choose "Create rule".
Define the Event Pattern:
Set the event source to AWS services.
For the service name, select "EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM)".
Choose the event type that corresponds to the completion of a maintenance window. The exact detail-type will depend on what SSM outputs, typically something like "AWS API Call via CloudTrail" if logging is enabled or a specific SSM event like "Maintenance Window Execution Status changed".
Here is an example event pattern for a rule that triggers when a maintenance window execution is completed:
json
Copy code
{
  "source": ["aws.ssm"],
  "detail-type": ["Maintenance Window Execution Status Change"],
  "detail": {
    "status": ["SUCCESS", "FAILED", "TIMED_OUT", "CANCELED"],
    "window-target-id": ["your-maintenance-window-id"]
  }
}
In this pattern, replace "your-maintenance-window-id" with the actual ID of the maintenance window you are interested in. The "status" array can be adjusted based on which statuses should trigger the function (e.g., only "SUCCESS" if you only want to act on successfully completed windows).
Set the Target:
Choose Lambda function as the target and select the Lambda function you have prepared.
Configure Input:
You can configure the input to pass to the Lambda function, either matching the event pattern or part of it, or even constant JSON that you define.
Deploy the Rule:
Name your rule, describe it, and enable it. Make sure your Lambda function's execution role has permission to be invoked by EventBridge.
Update Lambda IAM Role
Make sure that the IAM role used by your Lambda function has the necessary permissions. It should include permissions to be invoked by EventBridge. Add the following policy to the Lambda execution role if it's not already there:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:FUNCTION_NAME"
    }]
}
Replace REGION, ACCOUNT_ID, and FUNCTION_NAME with your specific details.

Testing and Validation
After setting everything up, it's good practice to test your configuration:

You might simulate the maintenance window execution using SSM commands or wait for a scheduled maintenance window to ensure that the Lambda function is triggered as expected.
Check the Lambda function logs in CloudWatch to verify it received and processed the event correctly.
This integration between SSM, EventBridge, and Lambda forms a powerful automation setup that can react immediately to changes in your AWS environment, particularly for operations like patch management.

I am working on replacing AMS monitoring with an in-house monitoring system, can you create all the automation along with needed lambda codes in Python in order to achieve it?
ChatGPT
Creating an in-house monitoring system to replace AMS (AWS Managed Services) monitoring involves several components, including setting up metrics collection, alerting, log aggregation, and automation through AWS services such as Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, and potentially others like Amazon Elasticsearch Service for log analytics. Below, I'll outline the high-level components and provide example Lambda code for typical monitoring tasks.

1. Metrics Collection
You'll likely use Amazon CloudWatch to collect metrics from your AWS resources. If you're using EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc., these services automatically send metrics to CloudWatch.

Custom Metrics: For custom application metrics, you can use the CloudWatch PutMetricData API. Here's a Python snippet for a Lambda function to push custom metrics:
python
Copy code
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
        Namespace='YourApplication',
        MetricData=[
            {
                'MetricName': 'ExampleMetric',
                'Dimensions': [
                    {
                        'Name': 'ServiceName',
                        'Value': 'YourService'
                    },
                ],
                'Unit': 'Count',
                'Value': 1.0
            },
        ]
    )
2. Alerting and Notifications
You can set up CloudWatch Alarms for any metric and have these alarms trigger a Lambda function or notify an SNS topic.

Create a CloudWatch Alarm using Boto3:
python
Copy code
def create_alarm():
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
        AlarmName='HighCPUUtilization',
        ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanThreshold',
        EvaluationPeriods=1,
        MetricName='CPUUtilization',
        Namespace='AWS/EC2',
        Period=300,
        Statistic='Average',
        Threshold=80.0,
        ActionsEnabled=True,
        AlarmActions=[
            'arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:alert-topic'
        ],
        AlarmDescription='Alarm when server CPU exceeds 80%',
        Dimensions=[
            {
                'Name': 'InstanceId',
                'Value': 'i-1234567890abcdef0'
            },
        ],
        Unit='Percent'
    )
3. Log Aggregation
AWS provides services like CloudWatch Logs for log storage and Amazon Elasticsearch Service for analysis. Lambda functions can be used to forward logs or perform real-time analysis.

Lambda Function for Log Processing:
python
Copy code
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Example: Process CloudWatch log data sent to Lambda via a subscription filter
    import base64
    import gzip
    import json

    # Decode and decompress the incoming data
    log_data = base64.b64decode(event['awslogs']['data'])
    decompressed_data = gzip.decompress(log_data)
    log_events = json.loads(decompressed_data)

    # Process each log event (this is where you could send to Elasticsearch, etc.)
    for log_event in log_events['logEvents']:
        print(log_event['message'])  # Example processing

    # Continue with any necessary log analysis or forwarding
4. Service Health Monitoring
Monitor the health and status of your services using Lambda functions to periodically check service endpoints or service-specific metrics, reporting any anomalies or issues.

Lambda Function for Health Check:
python
Copy code
import requests

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    response = requests.get("http://your.service.endpoint/health")
    if response.status_code != 200:
        # Notify via SNS or another mechanism
        sns = boto3.client('sns')
        sns.publish(
            TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:alert-topic',
            Message='Service health check failed!',
            Subject='Service Health Alert'
        )
Integration and Automation
EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events): Use this to trigger your Lambda functions based on a schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes for health checks) or in response to AWS service events.
Step Functions: Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows, such as remediation processes when certain alerts are triggered.
Final Steps
Testing and Validation: Ensure all components interact correctly. Test failure scenarios to confirm alerts and monitoring are effective.
Security and Compliance: Verify that your monitoring setup complies with your security policies, including data handling and access controls.
This approach covers monitoring infrastructure, applications, and network activities within AWS, allowing you to tailor the solution to the specific needs and scale of your organization. Each Lambda function provided can be deployed and scheduled according to your operational requirements.

I want to create a CloudWatch dashboard that lists all load balancers from all accounts; the dashboard should include the health of load balancers and the count of healthy and unhealthy targets per load balancer. Alarms also need to be created if the targets are unhealthy. Can you write the cdk code in python to achieve this?
ChatGPT
Creating a CloudWatch dashboard that lists all load balancers across all accounts, including their health and the count of healthy and unhealthy targets, involves several components and considerations. Additionally, setting up alarms for unhealthy targets and managing resources across multiple accounts can be complex, typically involving cross-account permissions and centralized management.

Here, I'll provide an example using AWS CDK in Python that outlines how you could approach creating such a dashboard and setting alarms for a single account. For multiple accounts, you would need to employ AWS Organizations and potentially AWS Lambda to aggregate data or use a central monitoring account that has permissions to access resources in all other accounts.

Initial Setup
First, make sure you have the AWS CDK installed. If not, you can install it using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g aws-cdk
Example CDK Code in Python
This example assumes you're managing resources within a single account. For multiple accounts, you'd need to replicate or adapt the following setup in each, or handle cross-account permissions.

Set up your CDK environment:
Create a new CDK project if you haven't already:
bash
Copy code
cdk init app --language python
Install necessary libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install aws-cdk.aws-elasticloadbalancingv2 aws-cdk.aws-cloudwatch
Create the CDK stack:
Here's a Python script for CDK that sets up a CloudWatch dashboard and creates alarms for unhealthy targets.

python
Copy code
from aws_cdk import (
    core,
    aws_elasticloadbalancingv2 as elbv2,
    aws_cloudwatch as cloudwatch
)

class LoadBalancerMonitoringStack(core.Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        # Dashboard
        dashboard = cloudwatch.Dashboard(self, "LoadBalancerDashboard", dashboard_name="LoadBalancerHealth")

        # Find all load balancers
        # NOTE: For multiple accounts, you would typically use a custom resource or an external process to discover and pass LBs
        load_balancers = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer.from_lookup(self, "LoadBalancer", load_balancer_arn="arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:...")

        # Assuming `load_balancers` is a list of load balancer objects
        for lb in load_balancers:
            # Health widget for the load balancer
            health_widget = cloudwatch.GraphWidget(
                title=f"Health - {lb.load_balancer_name}",
                left=[
                    lb.metric_healthy_host_count(),
                    lb.metric_unhealthy_host_count()
                ]
            )

            # Add widget to the dashboard
            dashboard.add_widgets(health_widget)

            # Create alarms for unhealthy targets
            unhealthy_alarm = cloudwatch.Alarm(self, f"UnhealthyHostsAlarm-{lb.load_balancer_name}",
                metric=lb.metric_unhealthy_host_count(),
                threshold=1,
                evaluation_periods=1,
                datapoints_to_alarm=1,
                comparison_operator=cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.GREATER_THAN_THRESHOLD,
                alarm_description="Alarm when one or more targets are unhealthy"
            )

            # Send notifications or take other actions here
            # Example: sns_topic.add_subscription(...)

app = core.App()
LoadBalancerMonitoringStack(app, "LoadBalancerMonitoringStack")
app.synth()
Considerations and Adaptations for Multiple Accounts:
Cross-Account Monitoring: You might need a central monitoring solution that uses AWS Lambda functions to aggregate data into a single account. This involves setting up cross-account permissions.
AWS Organizations: If using AWS Organizations, consider leveraging service control policies (SCPs) to standardize monitoring across accounts.
Automation: You can automate the deployment of monitoring resources using AWS Systems Manager or similar tools across accounts.
Testing and Deployment:
After writing your CDK code, you can deploy it using the command:
bash
Copy code
cdk deploy
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your AWS account to create these resources.
This setup provides a foundational approach to creating a CloudWatch dashboard and setting alarms for load balancers in AWS using CDK. For actual deployment in a multi-account environment, additional configurations around account management and permissions would be required.
