For an epic where provisioning AWS EC2 servers is automated with Jira tickets, the following tasks could be included:

1. Jira Integration
Task: Set up Jira automation workflows to trigger EC2 provisioning based on specific ticket events (e.g., ticket creation, status updates).
Description: Create Jira workflows that trigger Lambda functions or AWS services when a ticket is created or updated with specific criteria (e.g., approval status or specific labels).
2. Approval Process
Task: Define the approval mechanism for EC2 provisioning in Jira.
Description: Integrate an approval step where tickets require validation (from stakeholders or approvers) before EC2 provisioning begins.
3. EC2 Instance Configuration
Task: Define EC2 instance specifications based on Jira ticket parameters.
Description: Map Jira fields to EC2 instance configurations, such as instance type, AMI, security groups, VPC, key pairs, etc.
4. AWS Lambda for Provisioning
Task: Develop Lambda functions to automate the provisioning of EC2 instances.
Description: Create Lambda functions that read from the Jira API, retrieve ticket data, and use AWS SDK (Boto3) to spin up EC2 instances based on ticket information.
5. EC2 Tagging
Task: Automate the tagging of EC2 instances based on Jira ticket data.
Description: Automatically apply tags such as owner, project, and environment to the EC2 instance based on fields in the Jira ticket.
6. Resource Cleanup
Task: Automate resource deprovisioning based on Jira ticket closure.
Description: Implement cleanup logic to terminate EC2 instances when a ticket is closed or marked as completed, including tagging the instance for deprovisioning.
7. Notification and Updates
Task: Set up notifications for Jira ticket updates.
Description: Use SES or another notification service to update the ticket status, add comments, or notify the requester once the provisioning or deprovisioning is complete.
8. Security and IAM Roles
Task: Define IAM roles and permissions for provisioning.
Description: Ensure that the Lambda functions or other provisioning components have the necessary IAM roles to manage EC2 resources securely.
9. Cost Management
Task: Track costs and usage for each provisioned EC2 instance.
Description: Implement CloudWatch monitoring and integrate with AWS Cost Explorer to track and report costs for each provisioned instance based on tags like project or department from the Jira ticket.
10. Monitoring and Logging
Task: Set up logging and monitoring for provisioning processes.
Description: Integrate CloudWatch logs and metrics to monitor the status of EC2 provisioning, detect failures, and trigger alerts if necessary.
11. Jira Ticket Closure and Feedback Loop
Task: Automate feedback into Jira tickets.
Description: Automatically update the ticket with EC2 provisioning details (instance ID, IP address, region, etc.), and mark the task or subtasks as completed when the process finishes.
12. Testing and Validation
Task: Develop unit tests and validate the entire process.
Description: Test the entire workflow from ticket creation to EC2 instance provisioning and deprovisioning, including edge cases like failures, missing information, and security issues.
Each of these tasks would contribute to automating the end-to-end process of provisioning EC2 instances based on Jira tickets.
