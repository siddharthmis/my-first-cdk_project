Step-by-Step Guide to Creating an Incoming Webhook on Microsoft Teams:
Open Microsoft Teams:

Launch the Microsoft Teams desktop or web app.
Select the Desired Team and Channel:

In the left sidebar, find and select the Team where you want to add the webhook.
Select the specific channel within that Team where you want notifications to be sent.
Click on "Connectors":

Click on the ellipsis (...) next to the channel name where you want to add the webhook.
From the dropdown menu, select Connectors.
Search for Incoming Webhook:

In the "Connectors" panel, search for Incoming Webhook in the search bar.
Add Incoming Webhook:

Once you find Incoming Webhook, click Configure.
Configure the Webhook:

Name your Webhook: Enter a name for your webhook, which will be displayed when notifications are posted in the channel.
Upload an Image (Optional): You can upload an image to be associated with the webhook, which will appear next to the messages posted by the webhook.
Create the Webhook:

After configuring the webhook, click Create.
Copy the Webhook URL:

After creating the webhook, Teams will generate a Webhook URL.
Copy this URL — you’ll need it to send messages to the Teams channel from external applications (like AWS Lambda).
Save the Webhook URL:

Save the webhook URL somewhere secure, or use it immediately in your application (e.g., as an environment variable in AWS Lambda).
Finish:

Click Done to close the configuration window.
