Option 1: Get direct and nested group membership
powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-ADUser -Identity "username" -Properties MemberOf | Select-Object -ExpandProperty MemberOf
This gets the direct group memberships only.

‚úÖ Option 2: Get all groups including nested ones
To get all groups (direct and nested), use:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-ADUser -Identity "username" | Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership | Select-Object Name
This is typically the recommended approach as it also includes groups the user is a member of via nesting.

üõ†Ô∏è Example with domain-qualified name:
powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-ADUser -Identity "jdoe" | Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership | Select-Object Name, DistinguishedName
üîç If you don‚Äôt have the Active Directory module:
Make sure the RSAT tools are installed. You can install the AD module on Windows 10+ via:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell  # On Server
Or on Windows 10/11:

powershell
Copy
Edit
# If using PowerShell 5.1+ and you're on Windows 10/11
Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.ActiveDirectory* -Online | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
Let me know if you also need to check group membership of users across a domain, or need to export the list to CSV, etc.
