I want to remove older versions/vulnerabilities related to visual C++ from EC2 windows servers using SSM document. Can you provide a robust, fault-tolerant SSM document with excellent logging?

Below is an example AWS Systems Manager (SSM) document written in JSON that runs a PowerShell script on Windows EC2 instances. This script performs the following steps:

Creates a log directory/file: Ensures that a log file exists at C:\Temp\VCRemoval.log for detailed logging.
Queries installed Visual C++ packages: It checks both the 32‑bit and 64‑bit registry uninstall keys for any installed “Microsoft Visual C++” redistributables.
Identifies “older” or vulnerable versions: In this example, the script treats any installation whose name does not include “2015”, “2017”, “2019”, or “2022” as a candidate for removal. (Adjust the regex as needed for your environment.)
Attempts uninstallation: For each candidate, it calls the uninstall command (adding /quiet /norestart if not already present) and logs the outcome.
Robust error handling: Every step is wrapped in try/catch blocks, and all outcomes are logged with timestamps for excellent traceability.
You can modify the filtering criteria and logging paths to suit your environment. Copy the following SSM document and create a new document in your SSM console:

How It Works
Robust Logging: Every significant step (from querying installed programs to executing uninstalls) logs its activity with a timestamp, ensuring traceability.
Fault Tolerance: Try/catch blocks ensure that even if one uninstallation fails, the script continues processing the remaining items.
Customizable: Adjust the filtering criteria in the regex ('2015|2017|2019|2022') to suit the versions you intend to keep or remove.
Deploy this document using the AWS SSM console or AWS CLI, and then execute it on your target EC2 Windows servers. This solution should help you remove older versions of Visual C++ while maintaining robust error handling and logging.

Reasoned about uninstalling by version for 42 seconds
Below is an updated SSM document that uses the installed product’s version (from the registry’s DisplayVersion property) to decide whether to remove it. In this example, a parameter named MinimumVersionToKeep is defined (defaulting to 14.0.0.0) so that any Visual C++ installation with a version lower than that value is considered vulnerable or outdated and is uninstalled. You can adjust this threshold as needed.

This document continues to provide robust logging (writing detailed entries to C:\Temp\VCRemoval.log) and fault tolerance through try/catch blocks, ensuring that even if one uninstallation fails, the script continues processing the rest.

        ]
      }
    }

}
How It Works
Parameterization:
The MinimumVersionToKeep parameter (default: 14.0.0.0) is used to define the minimum acceptable version. Any Visual C++ installation with a version lower than this will be scheduled for removal.

Version Filtering:
After retrieving Visual C++ installations by matching the DisplayName, the script attempts to convert the DisplayVersion to a [version] object. If the conversion is successful and the version is lower than the defined threshold, that installation is marked for removal.

Robust Logging & Error Handling:
Logging is done to C:\Temp\VCRemoval.log for every significant step, including querying installed programs, filtering by version, and executing the uninstall command. The script uses try/catch blocks to ensure it can gracefully handle any errors while processing each entry.

Deploy this document using the AWS Systems Manager console or AWS CLI, and then execute it on your target Windows EC2 instances via SSM. Adjust the version threshold and any logging paths as needed for your environment.

Below is an updated SSM document that lets you pass in a comma-separated list of Visual C++ versions to be removed. In this example, a parameter called VersionsToRemove is defined. The PowerShell script splits this parameter into an array of version objects and then checks each installed Visual C++ package (using the registry’s DisplayVersion property). If the package’s version exactly matches one in your provided list, it’s marked for removal.

The script includes robust logging (writing detailed entries to C:\Temp\VCRemoval.log) and error handling so that even if one uninstallation fails, the script continues processing the remaining items.

}
How It Works
Parameterization:
The VersionsToRemove parameter allows you to pass a comma-separated list of Visual C++ versions (e.g., 12.0.0.0, 13.0.0.0). The script splits and trims this list, converting each entry into a [version] object for comparison.

Version Filtering:
The script queries the registry for installed Visual C++ packages. For each package that has a valid DisplayVersion, it converts that version into a [version] object and checks if it exists in your list of versions to remove. Only packages with versions that exactly match an entry in your list are marked for removal.

Robust Logging & Error Handling:
Detailed log entries are written to C:\Temp\VCRemoval.log at each step—from parameter parsing and version comparison to executing the uninstall command. Try/catch blocks ensure that errors during processing of any individual package do not stop the script from continuing.

Deploy this SSM document using the AWS Systems Manager console or AWS CLI, and then execute it on your target Windows EC2 instances via SSM. Adjust the parameter default and logging paths as needed for your environment.
